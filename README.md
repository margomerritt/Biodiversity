# Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

A dashboard is created to display interactive charts to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. The interactive tool displays demographic information per test subject ID number. The demographic info includes the personâ€™s ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, bellybutton type (BBTYPE) and washing frequency (WFREQ). Three types of charts are created from this demographic information: a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart.
